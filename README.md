Udaa or UpDate All Applications is a Windows command that utilizes Winget for updating most software on your device.

## Requrements

Winget (Windows 10 or later)

## How to get started?

1. Download the setup down below from the releases tab and run it
2. After installing use the command `udaa` in PowerShell or CMD

### Setup source code

Setup source code is provided in this repo in `/setup script`, just remove the `#` from the iss file to use the source of the installer.
(I've used `#` so the repo won't pick main language as Inno setup Script!)
