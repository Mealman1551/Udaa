Hello, the folder you are in right now is the folder with all the required missing dll's for version 1.1 of Update All Applications (Udaa)


You can download the patch as an exe that will do the following proccess automatically for you here: https://rb.gy/909yzz



If you want to patch by hand manually please follow the steps below:




Please follow these steps to patch 1.1 manually;

1. Download the dll's by clicking on them and in the upper right corner click the downwards arrow icon to download the dll's. (Only `python312.dll` is required and recommended but to make it faster you can also download the `vcruntime140.dll` and `vcruntime140_1.dll` files).

2. copy the dll(s) to "C\:Windows" and paste them there.

3. Run the command `udaa` in PowerShell or CMD, it will most likely run now!

If still persisting errors of such please open a GitHub issue.


Thank you,
